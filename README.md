Sentry on OpenShift
===================

Basic Setup
-----------

Create a new OpenShift app:

```
rhc app create -a <app_name> -t diy-0.1
```

Choose a database engine to install.

_note: if you have an older version of rhc you may need to use the syntax `rhc app cartridge add -c <db_cartrige> -a <app_name>`_

For **postgresql** (the default setup for this repo):

```
rhc cartridge add postgresql-8.4 -a <app_name>
```

For **mysql** (may be your preference, or installing mysql is having issues):

```
rhc cartridge add mysql-5.1 -a <app_name>
```

Add this upstream repo

```
cd <app_name>
git remote add upstream -m master git://github.com/755/openshift-sentry.git
git pull -s recursive -X theirs upstream master
```

Configuration
-------------

Edit sentry.conf.py:
```
SENTRY_KEY = 'super_secret_key'
```

Two additional changes if you are choosing mysql:

Firstly, change the database engine as well in sentry.conf.py from:
```
'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',  # Add 'postgresql_psycopg2', 'postgresql', 'mysql', 'sqlite3' or 'oracle'.
```
to:
```
'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',  # Add 'postgresql_psycopg2', 'postgresql', 'mysql', 'sqlite3' or 'oracle'.
```

Secondly, switch which database python package is commented out in requirements.txt:
```
psycopg2==2.4.5
#MySQL-python
```
(There should not be a problem if you leave both uncommented, you will just waste time installing things you do not need)

Deployment and final setup
--------------------------

Now, push the repo upstream

```
git push
```

Create superuser
* login to rhcloud
```
ssh c8812345:123214@<app_name>-namespace.rhcloud.com
```

* activate virtual env
```
source ${OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR}/${OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME}/bin/activate
```

* create superuser
```
sentry --config=$OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR/sentry.conf.py createsuperuser
```



**Warning:**
You need to create superuserÂ via ssh
